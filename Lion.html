	<h2> The Lion and The Rabbit </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		Once there was a Lion in the jungle who used to kill 2-3 animals daily for his meal. All animals went to him to tell, <br/>
		that daily one of them will come to him for his meal. <br/>
		So, the Lion agreed and this started going for many days.One day, it was Rabbitâ€™s turn. <br/>When he was on his way he saw a well. <br/>

Now he plans to kill the lion and save himself. He went to the lion and told him that, there is <br/>
another lion who claims to be more powerful than him. <br/>

Then the lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion. The rabbit takes him to the well <br/>
and said he lives here.  <br/>
When the lion looked in the well he saw his own reflection and jumped in <br/>
 the well and dies. <br/>
