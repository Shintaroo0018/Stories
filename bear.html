			Once there were two friends who were crossing the jungle. After some time they saw a bear coming towards them. <br/>
			Then, one of the friends quickly climbed the nearby tree and the other one did not know how to climb the tree. <br/>
			 So he lays down on the ground holding his breath. <br/>
The bear reaches near him and sniffs him in the ear. <br/>
After some time bear left the place, thinking the man is dead. <br/>
Now the other friend climbs down and asked his friend, what did bear said to him in his ear? <br/>
He replied,” to be safe from the fake friends.” <br/>
