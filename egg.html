	<h2> The Golden Egg </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg every day. The <br/>
		 egg provided enough money for the farmer and his wife to support their daily <br/>
		 needs. The farmer and his wife continued to be happy for a long time. <br/>

But, one day, the farmer thought to himself, “Why should we take just one egg a <br/>
day? Why can’t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?” The farmer <br/>
 told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed. <br/>

Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a  <br/>
sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding <br/>
all its golden eggs. But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was <br/>
guts and blood. <br/>

The farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost <br/>
 resource. As the days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. <br/>
 How jinxed and how foolish they were. <br/>
