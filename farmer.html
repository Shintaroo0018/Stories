	<h2> The Farmer and The Well </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		One day, a farmer was looking for a water source for his farm, when he bought a <br/>
		well from his neighbor. The neighbor, however, was cunning. The next day, as the <br/>
		farmer came to draw water from his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any <br/>
		water.<br/>

When the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, “I sold you the well, not the <br/>
water,” and walked away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for <br/>
 justice. He explained what had happened. <br/>

The emperor called on Birbal, one of his nine, and wisest, courtiers. Birbal <br/>
proceeded to question the neighbor, “Why don’t you let the farmer take water <br/> 
from the well? You did sell the well to the farmer?” <br/>

The neighbor replied, “Birbal, I did sell the well to the farmer but not the water <br/>
within it. He has no right to draw water from the well.” <br/>

Birbal said, “Look, since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in <br/>
 the farmer’s well. Either you pay rent to the farmer, or take it out immediately.” <br/>
 Realizing that his scheme had failed, the neighbor apologized and went home. <br/>
