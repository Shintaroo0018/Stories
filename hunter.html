	<h2> The Hunter and The Pigeon </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		One day a hunter sets a net to catch birds and placed grains and rice over the net.  <br/>
		After some time a flock of pigeons comes by and start eating grains and get caught in the net. <br/>
		After some time they started losing hope, then their leader asks them to fly together up in the sky. <br/>
		They did as they were told and carried the net away. <br/>
		The hunter runs after them but they flew away to their friendâ€™s mouse hole. <br/>
		 Then the mouse cuts the net and freed the pigeons. <br/>
