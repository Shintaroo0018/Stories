	<h2> The Milkmaid and Her Pail </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the <br/>
		cows, and then bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about <br/>
		what to spend her money on. <br/>

As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the <br/>
things she wanted to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a  <br/>
cake and a basket full of fresh strawberries. <br/>

A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the <br/>
money I get from today, I’m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will <br/>
lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk and eggs and get more money!” <br/>

She continued, “With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all <br/>
the other milkmaids jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting <br/>
about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering <br/>
Molly. <br/>

Drenched, Molly said to herself, “Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a <br/>
chicken now.” She went home with her empty pails. <br/>

“Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?” Molly’s mother asked. <br/>

“I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about <br/>
the pails,” she answered. <br/>

“Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don’t count your chickens <br/>
 until they hatch?’” <br/>
