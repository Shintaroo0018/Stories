	<h2> A Wise Old Owl </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		There was an old owl who lived in an oak tree. Every day, he observed incidents <br/>
		that occurred around him. <br/>

Yesterday, he watched as a young boy helped an old man carry a heavy basket. <br/>
Today, he saw a young girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw, the less he <br/>
spoke. <br/>

As the days went on, he spoke less but heard more. The old owl heard people <br/>
talking and telling stories. <br/>

He heard a woman saying an elephant jumped over a fence. He heard a man <br/>
saying that he had never made a mistake. <br/>

The old owl had seen and heard what happened to people. There were some who <br/>
became better, some who became worse. But the old owl in the tree had become <br/>
wiser, each and every day. <br/>
