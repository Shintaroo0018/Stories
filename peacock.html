	<h2> The Crow and The Peacock </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		Once there was a crow who wishes to be colorful and beautiful like other birds. <br/>
		 He then went to the parrot and shared his thoughts. <br/>
		But parrot said peacock is most beautiful bird so talk to him. <br/> 
		Then the crow went to the peacock and told him about his looks. <br/>

Then the peacock replied,” You are the luckiest bird that has been never caged <br/>
in life and we because of our beauty stay caged, and you are always free.” <br/>
After listening to this, crow realized his mistake and thanked God for making <br/>
him like this and he flew away happily. <br/>
