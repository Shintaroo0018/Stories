	<h2> The Proud Rose </h2>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
		Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her <br/>beautiful looks. Her only complaint was growing next to an ugly cactus. <br/>

Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all <br/>
while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose <br/>
see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks. <br/>

One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the  <br/>
plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their  <br/>
lush color. <br/>

Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink <br/>
some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some <br/>
 water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough <br/>
 summer, as friends. <br/>
